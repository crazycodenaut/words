Life is complicated. 

That's too vague and generic. What do I really want to say? 

Life is complicated. 

It most certainly is. What's your point? 

Life is complicated. 

I'm visiting the Microsoft campus this evening. After I graduated from UCI I spent five years romanticizing these buildings. I idolized the developers that came before me. I tried to walk in their shoes, and to see the world the way they did. “let them be your giants,” I granted myself. 

I often say that I don't believe in a soul, and yet my mind has a construct for the concept. When I interrogate it, I find that the imagery I associate with a soul is similar to that of one's intentions. Intentions, I define, are the actions we intend to take in the future. If you've ever seen the movie Donnie Darko, it's like the silver stream that emits from Donnie’s center of mass in the scenes where they talk about time travel. It precedes him before he enters a room, and seems to grab at the doors before him. It's his mind's intentions being illustrated. I think that some people have souls that extend far beyond the immediate vicinity. Those people fascinate me. 

As I walk the campus, I recall my last few days as an employee, almost two years ago now. I was laden with fear, angst, dread. I was going to kill myself, I had secretly plotted. My soul ached like never before. “why am I doing this to myself?” I begged my mind to lay out the logic, one more time. “Principles,” a stern voice I hardly recognized emitted from within. I had been put on a plan for underperforming the past few months. I kicked myself. The primary reasons for moving to this team were to be close to ‘her’ and because I believed I was a team player, and the initial offering was to ‘help out ‘ this other manager. Now he felt I was performing poorly. It stung like betrayal. Worse, still, ‘she’ had moved to another team. Things just weren't going according to my unspoken plan.
 
I've been writing code since I was 12, and designing before I even knew what the word meant. I sometimes argue to myself that if someone had given me a team of cooperative developers as a child, I could have made small waves in certain circles. That's why the performance plan particularly ached. It was either a reality check, or someone wanted to hurt me. I began to compensate with drugs. I acquired Adderall and LSD and figured out how to make them work as best I could. I didn't have a lot of time to experiment so whatever I did, I couldn't be sure helped or hurt. I tried to rise to the challenge; I sincerely did, but the voice of “unjust reason” was too loud. The emotionality of it clouded my judgement. “Why was this happening to me?” I begged my mind to understand. The responses came from the ego: I was being used. It was a loyalty test. They hate me because I don't fit in. They felt threatened. You name it, I had the thought. I've even had many more since then. I voiced my decision to leave. They offered a severance. $15,000. I went to Spain. 

These are the memories that flood over me as I stroll. The frogs sing. It is deafening. “Make an impact,” a sign on the grass reads. I smirk. Fire Lane - No Parking - Water Valve - the stop sign blinks. The logic of the signage ruins the naturesque beauty of the campus. I imagined a city with no streets once. It was beautiful. Uninterruptedly so. 

Still, there is something about the campus that makes me giddy. Excited bliss washes over me when I put aside my past and simply realize what the campus is. It's so many minds working together in unison. It's an honest attempt at harmony. If I may rob it of humanity for a moment: it's raw, mental horsepower; like a giant computer executing instructions; instructions to build the future. I remember a tweet, “Amdahl's law applies to everything”- my soul aches; I don't belong. “Make an impact,” - the stop sign blinks. All ways. Signage. 

I cross a street. It causes me to recall the pretty obsessive crush I had. She was overwhelming. When I was around her all my speech was lost; my mental faculties went to keeping myself collected. All I could do was watch her. I'm a creep. We walked this way once. We kept a slow pace, and as usual I sweated too much, and scanned frequently for topics that might light her up. On this particular walk, a woman moving at a faster pace pushed her way between us to be past. I glanced at my crush to see her reaction. Her eyes, as daggers, tore in to the back of the intruder. I was in love. Back in the present, a male and female duck cross my path. I think the world remembers that day too. 

Making the turn, I fondle the Swiss Army Knife in my pocket. I walk past the old building I worked in. Along this street the seasons were poignant. It's cold tonight. I've been homeless for almost seven months now. Not by my own choosing, but because my soul has been caged. “they” say it's because I'm punishing myself. I call it bullshit psychology. I think that “they “ are pulling a fast one. I also think that “they “ are projecting. Realizing these things makes my soul ache, and so my mind aches, and thusly : I ache. I don't try to hide the pain anymore. I yell at the air. I know they're always watching. “give them a good show “ I retort - my soul cries “betrayal of self”. “Principles, “ rings my ego, “they must be destroyed.“ Calm. I have an angry soul, I conclude. “Rightfully so,” I voice. 
Another set of signage : “Make an impact,” - a blinking stop sign - emergency. 

As I close my circuit, I force myself to examine a piece of art sitting in front of a cafeteria. There is no sign or placard indicating the intentions of the artist, and so I let it be whatever I want it to be. Analytically speaking, it's three pieces of metal rising up from the ground, each lined with a unique secondary colored lighting - magenta, cyan and yellow. It is her, I conclude. Then, for a moment I wonder if there is a complementary, primary colored version somewhere else on campus. Maybe it hasn't been built yet. Then, I wonder if it ever will be.
